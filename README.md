Dazy Spell Font is a display typeface created specifically for a game GameMaker Game named [dazy.](https://waspiewoice.itch.io/dazy) It has a pixelated, retro aesthetic that complements the vintage-inspired visuals of the game. The font includes the basic 68 characters required for most common uses.

As this is the author's first font creation, it lacks certain refinements, with legibility being one of the more notable limitations. Therefore, it is recommended to use Dazy Spell Font primarily for headers or titles, rather than for the body text of important content, where readability is crucial.
